## a2-calemdar Rock Paper Scissors
This web application lets you play different variations of the game Rock 
Paper Scissors

In this project I learned and faced:
- figuring out how to fetch data using server requests
- UI tricks about buttons, responsive elements with dynamic sizes
- many problems dealing with incoming data, and parsing it correctly
- this application doesn't try to solve any problems, it is just for entertainment
- I want to go deeper into how to make a responsive, easy to use UI
- For the tabular dataset, I am only keeping three fields in the "appdata". There are multiple user inputs I am handling, but I handle them with event listeners, so I could not store those in the server. (there must be another way)
